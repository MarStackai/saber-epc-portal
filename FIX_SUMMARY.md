# ðŸ”§ Form Redirect Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified
When partners submitted the form, it was redirecting to a local file path:
`file:///home/marstack/Downloads/index.html`

## Root Causes Found
1. **Relative URLs** - JavaScript was using relative paths ('index.html') instead of absolute SharePoint URLs
2. **Missing Authentication Check** - Main form didn't verify if user was authenticated
3. **Form Action** - Form tag didn't explicitly prevent default submission
4. **Session Management** - Redirects weren't using SharePoint base URLs

## Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated JavaScript (script-fixed.js)
- Added SharePoint base URL configuration
- Implemented authentication check on page load
- Fixed form submission to prevent any redirects
- Added explicit preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
- Ensures form stays on SharePoint after submission

### 2. Updated verify-access.html
- Changed redirect from `'index.html'` to full SharePoint URL
- Now redirects to: `https://saberrenewables.sharepoint.com/sites/SaberEPCPartners/SiteAssets/EPCForm/index.html`

### 3. Updated index.html
- Added `action="#"` and `onsubmit="return false;"` to form tag
- Changed script reference to use fixed version
- Prevents any default form submission behavior

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
```
1. Partner visits: /verify-access.html
2. Enters email + invitation code
3. On success â†’ Redirects to SharePoint URL (not local)
4. Main form checks authentication
5. If not authenticated â†’ Redirects back to verify page
```

### Submission Flow:
```
1. Partner completes form
2. Clicks submit â†’ JavaScript handles it
3. Prevents default form submission
4. Shows success modal
5. Stays on SharePoint (no redirect to local files)
6. After 3 seconds â†’ Clears form
7. After 6 seconds â†’ Hides modal
```

## Testing Instructions
