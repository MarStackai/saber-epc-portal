## 📋 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Problem 1: Files Downloading Instead of Displaying
- **Issue:** HTML files were downloading instead of opening in browser
- **Solution:** Created SharePoint Site Page with embedded form
- **Result:** Form now displays directly in browser

### Problem 2: Missing Branding
- **Issue:** Logo not showing, no Saber blue header
- **Solution:** Embedded SVG logo and inline CSS
- **Result:** Full branding preserved with Saber colors

### Problem 3: Form Redirecting to Local File
- **Issue:** Form submission redirected to file:///Downloads
- **Solution:** Updated all URLs to absolute SharePoint paths
- **Result:** Form stays within SharePoint environment

### Problem 4: Access Permissions (403 Errors)
- **Issue:** Direct file access returned 403 Forbidden
- **Solution:** Created Site Page with proper SharePoint permissions
- **Result:** Form accessible to authorized users

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### User Flow:
1. Partner receives invitation with link and code
2. Visits the SharePoint page URL
3. Enters email and invitation code (ABCD1234)
4. Completes 4-step onboarding form:
   - Step 1: Company Details
   - Step 2: Capabilities
   - Step 3: Documentation Upload
   - Step 4: Review & Submit
5. Receives confirmation message
6. Data stored in SharePoint lists

### Technical Architecture:
```
SharePoint Site Page (epc-partner-portal.aspx)
    └── Embeds → verify-access-branded.html
            └── Validates → invitation code
                    └── Redirects → index.html (main form)
                            └── Submits → SharePoint Lists
```
